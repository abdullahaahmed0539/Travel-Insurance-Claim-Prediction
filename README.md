# Travel-Insurance-Claim-Prediction
Building a machine learning model for the insurance company to predict if the insurance buyer will claim their travel insurance or not. 
The flow of the project is according to the CRISP-DM model which is:

  1) Business problem understanding
  2) Data understanding
  3) Data preparation
  4) Modelling
  5) Evaluation
  
The project uses 5 Machine Learning models. These are:
  
  1) Decision Trees
  2) Random Forest
  3) Logistic Regression
  4) Gradient Boost
  5) Naive Bayes
  
After creating the models, we have generated a detailed report on our analysis and workings. It also proposes the best model for prediction out of the 5 models above.
